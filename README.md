File Encryption-Decryption Tool
====================
Developer:  Gangsters (^-^)
Subject: Programming Fundamentals
Date: July 2025

Overview:
---------
This project implements a simple file encryption and decryption tool
using C++. The program reads a text file, shifts each character by a 
user-defined shift value, and writes the output to another file.

Features:
---------
- File input and output operations using ifstream and ofstream.
- Basic byte-shift encryption and decryption.
- User-friendly console interface.
- Validates user input for shift values and choices.
- Option to decrypt immediately after encryption.

Usage Instructions:
-------------------
1. Run the program.
2. Choose to encrypt or decrypt a file.
3. Enter input and output file names (e.g., input.txt).
4. Enter a shift value between 1 and 25.
5. If encrypting, you may choose to decrypt immediately.
6. Check the output files for results.

Notes:
------
- This encryption method is not secure for real-world use.
- It is meant to practice file handling and basic encryption logic.
