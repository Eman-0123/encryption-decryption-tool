üîç Overview:
This project implements a simple file encryption and decryption tool using C++.
It reads text from a file, applies a character shift based on a user-defined value,
and writes the encrypted or decrypted result to another file.

---
‚ú® Features:

File input/output using ifstream and ofstream

Basic byte-shift encryption and decryption

User-friendly console interface

Shift value validation (1 to 25)

Option to decrypt immediately after encryption
---

üõ† Usage Instructions:

1. Run the program.

2. Choose to encrypt a file.

3. Enter the input and output file names (e.g., input.txt).

4. Enter a shift value between 1 and 25.

5. After encryption, choose whether to decrypt the file.

6. Check the output files to see the results.
---
‚ö† Notes:

This encryption method is basic and not suitable for real-world security.

It is created solely for practicing file handling and simple encryption logic in C++.
